== Importing houses

In this next section we're going to import the houses that characters belong to.

Run the following query to explore the houses CSV file:

[source, cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}/houses.csv" AS row
RETURN row
----

Now let's create a node with the `House` label for each row in the file:

[source, cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}/houses.csv" AS row
MERGE (house:House {id: row.link})
ON CREATE SET house.name = row.name
----

Run the following query to return all the houses:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (house:House)
RETURN house
----

You should see 73 nodes if the import has worked as expected.

== Exercise: Create allegiances

Now it's your turn!
Run the following query to view the allegiances between characters and houses:

[source, cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}/characters_houses.csv" AS row
RETURN row.character, row.house
----

Now create a `HAS_ALLEGIANCE_TO` relationship for each character/house pair in the file.

== Answer: Create allegiances

[source, cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}/characters_houses.csv" AS row
MATCH (character:Character {id: row.character})
MATCH (house:House {id: row.house})
MERGE (character)-[:HAS_ALLEGIANCE_TO]->(house)
----

== Exploring allegiances

Run the following query to check that the allegiances have been created:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (character:Character)-[:HAS_ALLEGIANCE_TO]->(house)
RETURN character.id, character.name, count(*) AS allegiances
ORDER BY allegiances DESC
----

You should see `Randyll Tarly` in first place with 4 houses.

== Exercise: What houses do people have allegiance to?

Time for another mini exercise.

See if you can tweak the query from the previous slide to include the names of the houses as well as the count.

_Tip_ The link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/aggregating/#functions-collect[`collect` function] will be helpful.

== Answer: What houses do people have allegiance to?

We just need to add a call to `collect()` as part of our `RETURN` statement:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (character:Character)-[:HAS_ALLEGIANCE_TO]->(house)
RETURN character.id, character.name, collect(house.name) AS houses, count(*) AS allegiances
ORDER BY allegiances DESC
----

== Appearances of the Starks

In the previous guide we wrote the following query to find the `Stark` character who appeared in the least episodes.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (character:Character)-[:APPEARED_IN]->()
WHERE character.name ENDS WITH "Stark"
RETURN character.id, character.name, count(*) AS appearances
ORDER BY appearances
LIMIT 1
----

This query made the assumption that all members of `House Stark` had a name that ended in `Stark`, which isn't necessarily the case.

The following query finds the most prominent members of `House Stark` who don't have a `Stark` surname:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (:House {name: "House Stark"})<-[:HAS_ALLEGIANCE_TO]-(character:Character)-[:APPEARED_IN]->()
WHERE NOT(character.name ENDS WITH "Stark")
RETURN character.id, character.name, count(*) AS appearances
ORDER BY appearances DESC
----

Try tweaking the query to see if there are prominent characters of other houses who don't have the surname of that House.

== Multiple aggregations

Let's revisit one of our queries from the first section where we found the characters who'd appeared in the most episodes:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (character:Character)-[:APPEARED_IN]->()
RETURN character.name, count(*) AS appearances
ORDER BY appearances DESC
----

It would be cool to see which houses each character had allegiance too as well.
We might try to extend the query to use the `collect` function to do this with the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (house:House)<-[:HAS_ALLEGIANCE_TO]-(character:Character)-[:APPEARED_IN]->()
RETURN character.id, character.name, collect(house.name) AS houses, count(*) AS appearances
ORDER BY appearances DESC
----

Unfortunately, this doesn't give us the result we might have expected.
We've got the house names repeated loads of times and `appearances` is now wrong!

== Multiple aggregations

The problem is that we're doing aggregations across different relationships.
But we're trying to do it all in one go.

Look at the slides for an explanation of how we can use the `WITH` keyword to get around this:

== Multiple aggregations using `WITH`

The following query will correctly calculate the houses and appearances for each character:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (house:House)<-[:HAS_ALLEGIANCE_TO]-(character:Character)
WITH character, collect(house.name) AS houses
MATCH (character)-[:APPEARED_IN]->()
RETURN character.id, character.name, houses, count(*) AS appearances
ORDER BY appearances DESC
----

== Exercise

Update the query to:

* only show characters who have appeared in 30 or more episodes.
* and have allegiance to more than 1 house.

_Tip_ The link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/with/[WITH] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-size[size()] documentation pages are your friends.

== Answer: only show characters who have appeared in 30 or more episodes.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (house:House)<-[:HAS_ALLEGIANCE_TO]-(character:Character)

WITH character, collect(house.name) AS houses
MATCH (character)-[:APPEARED_IN]->()

WITH character, houses, count(*) AS appearances
WHERE appearances >= 30

RETURN character.id, character.name, houses, appearances
ORDER BY appearances DESC
----

== Answer: only show characters who have appeared in 30 or more episodes and have allegiance to more than 1 house.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (house:House)<-[:HAS_ALLEGIANCE_TO]-(character:Character)

WITH character, collect(house.name) AS houses
WHERE size(houses) > 1
MATCH (character)-[:APPEARED_IN]->()

WITH character, houses, count(*) AS appearances
WHERE appearances >= 30

RETURN character.id, character.name, houses, appearances
ORDER BY appearances DESC
----

== Next Step

In the next section, we're going to look at the relationships between different characters and the houses they belong to.
