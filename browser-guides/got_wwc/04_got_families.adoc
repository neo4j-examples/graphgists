== Importing families

In this final section, we're going to import the family relationships between characters.

Run the following query to explore the family ties CSV file:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}/family_ties.csv" AS row
RETURN row
----

We've got mother and father relationships between pairs of characters.
The father relationships are a bit more nuanced which we can see by running the following query:

[source,cypher, subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}/family_ties.csv" AS row
RETURN DISTINCT row.relationship, row.type
----

We have biological fathers, adoptive and legal fathers.

== Importing families

First let's import the mother relationships.
We'll create a `PARENT_OF` relationship from a mother to their child for each row in the CSV file:

[source, cypher, subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}/family_ties.csv" AS row
WITH row WHERE row.relationship = "mother"
MATCH (character1:Character {id: row.character1})
MATCH (character2:Character {id: row.character2})
MERGE (character2)-[:PARENT_OF {type: "mother"}]->(character1)
----

Now we'll do the same with the fathers but we'll also record the type of father relationship as part of the `type` property on the relationship.

[source, cypher, subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}/family_ties.csv" AS row
WITH row WHERE row.relationship = "father"
MATCH (character1:Character {id: row.character1})
MATCH (character2:Character {id: row.character2})
MERGE (character2)-[:PARENT_OF {type: row.type + " " + row.relationship}]->(character1)
----

== Who are Jon Snow's parents?

Now we can finally start exploring the relationships between different characters.
We'll start by finding Jon Snow's parents:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path = (character:Character {name: "Jon Snow"})<-[:PARENT_OF]-(parent)
RETURN path
----

This query returns both his biological and adoptive fathers.
If we want to only return his biological parents we can tweak the query like so:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path = (character:Character {name: "Jon Snow"})<-[parentOf:PARENT_OF]-(parent)
WHERE parentOf.type IN ["mother", "biological father"]
RETURN path
----

== Who are Jon Snow's biological grandparents?

And finally we can find Jon Snow's biological grandparents!

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path = (:Character {name: "Jon Snow"})<-[:PARENT_OF*..2]-(parent)
WHERE all(x in relationships(path) WHERE x.type IN ["mother", "biological father"])
RETURN path
----
