== Welcome to Neo4j!

Neo4j is a database, a storage for *things* and their *relationships*.

It is operated with a language called _Cypher_.

With it, you can store things, but also find them again.

Let's try that now. Continue with the arrow to the right.

== Save things

We can create ourselves:

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (me:Person {name: 'Jennifer'})
RETURN me
----

And then we can find ourselves, too:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Jennifer'})
RETURN p
----

We show things as circles: `()` or `(:person {name: 'Jennifer'})`

Can you find your neighbors? Give it a try!

We can also find all the people:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN p
----

== Change things

We can also store more than the name, like birthday or favorite color.

We can find each other and then add new information.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Jennifer'})
SET p.birthday = 'May'
SET p.color = 'green'
RETURN p
----

Now we can see who all likes the color `green`.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.color = 'green'
RETURN p
----

What if we wanted to find out who doesn't like the color green? Or who has a birthday in `July`?

== Connect things

For this, we need two (a pair) of things.

Find *you* and *your* neighbor to your right.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person {name: 'Jennifer'})
MATCH (b:Person {name: 'Diego'})
RETURN a,b
----

Relationships are arrows like `+-->+` or `+-[:KNOWS]->+`.

Now we can connect the neighbors.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person {name: 'Jennifer'})
MATCH (b:Person {name: 'Diego'})
MERGE (a)-[k:KNOWS]->(b)
RETURN *
----

How long is our chain? Could we find all the groups of neighbors?

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (a)-[k:KNOWS]->(b)
RETURN *
----

== What can you save?

Answer: ANYTHING!

* Hobbies, friends, family
* People, movies, songs, books, comics
* Countries, cities, streets
* Schools, classes, dates and times
* Stars, planets, animals, plants

Or whatever you feel like and what you are interested in.

Let's have a look at two things: 

* pass:a[<a play-topic='movies'> movies</a>]
* pass:a[<a play-topic='query-template'>helper</a>]
